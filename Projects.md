#### Recent Projects

- Minimum Time-to-Climb of a Supersonic Aircraft . [Dec'20]

<p> This project compares the optimal trajectory generated by a direct shooting method, i.e., Legendre-Gauss-Radau (LGR) direct collocation method, and an indirect shooting method, i.e., Pontryaginâ€™s maximum principle (PMP), for a modern supersonic aircraft. </p>

- Integral concurrent learning: adaptive control with parameter convergence.  [May'20]

<p> In this project, the result from paper has been reconstructed. In the original paper, a modified CL adaptive update law has been developed, resulting in guarantees on the convergence of the parameter estimation errors without requiring PE or the estimation of state derivatives. </p>

- Incremental quasi-newton method with local superlinear convergence rate.  [May'20]

<p> In this project, the result from a paper has been reconstructed. In the original paper a Incremental quasi-newton method has been developed. IQN is the first stochastic quasi-Newton method proven to converge superlinearly in a local neighborhood of the optimal solution. </p>

- A hierarchical, scale separation-based approach to wind-aware guidance and control.  [2019]
<p> Monte-Carlo analysis and feasibility analysis of a novel modified A star algorithm for trajectory generation considering wind characteristics. </p>

- Intruder UAVs avoidance using Grey Wolf Algorithm.  [May'19]

<p> In this project, a simulation framework using Netlogo has been developed using a famous metaheuristics algorithm named "Grey Wolf Algorithm". </p>
