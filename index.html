<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<p> Hi! I am Nahid from Bangladesh. I am an incoming Ph.D. student at the Purdue- School of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Previously, I have worked as a Research Engineer at the Systems, Cognition, and Control Laboratory (SCC Lab), Oklahoma State University (OSU). I received my M.S. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the Oklahoma State University, advised by <a href="https://scc-lab.github.io/people/rushikesh_kamalapurkar.html">Prof. Rushikesh Kamalapurkar</a>; and my B.S. in Mechanical
Engineering at the Islamic University of Technology, Bangladesh. My previous research was focused on developing novel control architectures for synthesizing safe controllers based on online model-based learning policies with a specific focus on deploying them in autonomous systems. </p>
